Display 7SegmentReader
===========
Built using Python OpenCV.

Using the config.ini enable the number of 3 digit numbers you want to read.
Within the config.ini set the ip address you wish to send data to.
Select which digit you would like to set up from the menu.
Move the box and adjust the size so that each of the red dots fall within each of the 7 segments.
Adjust the threshold slider for each selection so that the number is clearly visible with as little noise as possible. 
box locations and threshold values are only saved when the programme is closed via the exit button, or the escape key 'q' is pressed.
